This script will archive cron or for that matter any output
to a CouchDB document. There are two main drivers

 - Reduce the amount of cron e-mail spam
 - Have logs of cron jobs that can be correlated to adverse events

Script will log following items

  - Command line used
  - Hostname script ran on
  - Username script ran on
  - Time started
  - How long the job took (job_duration)
  - Exit/return code of the job


REQUIREMENTS
============

- CouchDB 0.10+ for storage
- curl web client installed on all the nodes running cronologger

INSTALLATION
============

First create a database on CouchDB. 

Then at top of cronologger script define the URL to CouchDB ie.

URL_BASE="http://localhost:5984/cronologger"

You could also define environment variables CRONOLOGGER_SERVER (defaults to localhost)
and CRONOLOGGER_DB (defaults cronologger) ie.

export CRONOLOGGER_SERVER=couch01
export CRONOLOGGER_DB=crondb

RUNNING
=======

To run it simply precede a command with the cronologger command ie.

  cronologger /usr/local/bin/backup_db.sh

That's it. Check out CouchDBs web interface 

http://localhost:5984/_utils/

on your CouchDB you should see an entry for the job that just ran.

WEB GUI
=======

There is PHP based web GUI however you have to create CouchDB views to be able
to use it. You can find the view specification in cronview.json. To install/refresh the
view define CRONOLOGGER_SERVER and CRONOLOGGER_DB variables and run refresh_view.sh

export CRONOLOGGER_SERVER=couch01
export CRONOLOGGER_DB=crondb

Copy contents of the web subdirectory to your web document root ie. /var/www/html/cronologger.
To configure web GUI create a config.php file which should only contain values that
override the default values specified in config.default.php e.g.

<?php

$couchdb_server = "couch01";

?>

The web interface requires php >= 5.2, and 'allow_url_fopen = On' configured in your 
php.ini file.

Enjoy.
